# StyleGen
StyleGen is a machine learning training pipeline leveraging stable diffusion processes such as Dreambooth-LORA in order to allow users to create models that generate audio that mimics the style of a song but with minor changes through text commands, all done from Google Colab free-tier notebooks through optimization.
